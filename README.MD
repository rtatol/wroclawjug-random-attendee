<H1>WJUG Random Attendee</H1>

hello and welcome

this is my simple tool to select a random attendee on a WJUG (Warsaw Java User Group) meetup.

basically it is an angular 2 playground, which I suck at (or frontend in general), so don't expect miracles :)

If you, my dear reader, find it useful - be my guest. Fork it, copy it, steal it, do whatever you want. For details please refer to the license file.<h2>Building</h2>
